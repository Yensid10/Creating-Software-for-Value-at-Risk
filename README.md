• All other programs included within my PROJECT Git repository are simple python programs that can just be ran normally, these mainly being found within the ``Command Line VaR Programs'' folders for terms 1 and 2. The main code for this report is contained within the ``Final Design'' folder. 

It can be ran as a normal python program called ``Final Design.py'', but this would require further installations of various Python libraries that are documented within this report. 

The much easier alternative is to use the executable file found within the ``dist'' sub folder, which can be ran without any further installations. The executable file is called ``MCaT.exe''. It is all in the branch “Master”, as I was having issues with my “Main” branch.

There is a Kivy folder that was used in the development of my deliverable for a previous term. There are multiple documentation folders, each one for a different section of documentation that I had to write.
