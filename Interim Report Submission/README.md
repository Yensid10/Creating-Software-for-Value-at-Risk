# Final Year Project
• Youtube Video showcasing Term 1 main program: https://youtu.be/2GIWug_IESI

• All other programs included within my PROJECT Git repository are simple python programs that can just be ran normally, these mainly being found within the "Command Line VaR Programs" folder. The GUI program has been compiled into a .exe file within the main directory, called “Initial Design Test.exe”, it will open up a terminal when ran but please ignore it, it should work perfectly otherwise. The code for it is within the "Kivy" folder, that has other kivy tests inside it as well. It is all in the branch "Master", as I was having issues with my "Main" branch. If viewing from the Zip submitted, it should not matter about the branch.
