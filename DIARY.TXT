FINAL YEAR PROJECT DIARY
-------------------------

28/9/23 - Start of Project
Today, I am starting this project. I have finally fully recovered from a health issue I was having at the start 
of term, but I am still dealing with an ongoing emotional issues that I will have to push through to complete
this project successfully (heartbreak).

01/10/23 - Setting Up LaTeX
I have been able to get Latex working for my Documentation, after having various problems with the version of LaTeX
I installed not working with VSCode. I finally used Latex Live and was able to get it working, thus have created 
a test document to ensure it works. I have started researching and acquiring sources for my project, and will need 
to ensure I complete the Project Plan accordingly.

17/10/23 - Fixing my DIARY
Due to illnesses (that are still ongoing), I have not been able to properly update this diary to a satisfactory level. When my illness has rescinded, I will be able to start continuously updating this diary with my projects progress...

11/11/23 - Finally being able to get on with working
Have finally gotten illnesses and emotional issues under control, and have been able to start working on my project. I've used the sources I originally found to help me understand VaR for historical simulation and variance covariance model methods, whilst also using trial and error to create two test programs to test the methods. I need to start on the documentation for the project tomorrow with creating the latex for it and making sure to document my progress in understanding var as well.
