FINAL YEAR PROJECT DIARY
-------------------------

28/9/23 - Start of Project
Today, I am starting this project. I have finally fully recovered from a health issue I was having at the start 
of term, but I am still dealing with an ongoing emotional issues that I will have to push through to complete
this project successfully (heartbreak).

01/10/23 - Setting Up LaTeX
I have been able to get Latex working for my Documentation, after having various problems with the version of LaTeX
I installed not working with VSCode. I finally used Latex Live and was able to get it working, thus have created 
a test document to ensure it works. I have started researching and acquiring sources for my project, and will need 
to ensure I complete the Project Plan accordingly.

17/10/23 - Fixing my DIARY
Due to illnesses (that are still ongoing), I have not been able to properly update this diary to a satisfactory level. When my illness has rescinded, I will be able to start continously updating this diary with my projects progress...
